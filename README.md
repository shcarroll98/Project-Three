# Project-Three
Data Engineering: While we know that S&P 500 is the most famous financial benchmark in the world, we wanted to look closer at the data how ESG for these companies. We found two different datasets on Kaggle, SP500 Stocks and Public Company ESG Ratings dataset. We decided to merge the two by their common columns, "ticker" and "last processing date". Before we could do that, we had to change the date format to be consistent.
